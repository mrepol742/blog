```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
}
```
Hello world is a phrase that is often used to introduce someone to the world of programming. It is a
        simple phrase that is used to demonstrate the basic syntax of a programming language. In its
        simplest form, it is a statement that prints the phrase "Hello world" to the screen. However, it can
        also be used to demonstrate more complex concepts such as variables, functions, and classes.
        
```sh
$_ java helloworld.java
$_ Hello World
```
        
        
The phrase "Hello
        world" can also be used to demonstrate more complex concepts such as variables, functions, and
        classes. Variables are used to store data and can be used to store strings, numbers, and other data
        types. Functions are used to perform specific tasks and can be used to create custom code. Classes
        are used to create objects and can be used to create custom objects.
