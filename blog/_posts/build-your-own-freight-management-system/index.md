Looking to launch or enhance a freight management platform? The open-source **AxleShift Core‚Äë1** repository offers a powerful foundation for clients to bootstrap their own freight systems‚Äîfrom order entry to smart scheduling and real-time notifications.

## What Is AxleShift Core‚Äë1?

The [AxleShift Core‚Äë1 GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrepol742/axleshift-core1) is the back‚Äëend heart of the AxleShift platform, providing core freight management services including:

* **Order management** ‚Äì create, update, schedule orders
* **Planning & scheduling** ‚Äì assign shipments, configure delivery timelines
* **Real‚Äëtime notifications** ‚Äì update clients and stakeholders on shipment status

This module enables you to rapidly launch freight workflows with built‚Äëin logic and notification capabilities‚Äîwithout reinventing the wheel.

## Why Use Core‚Äë1 as a Starting Point?

Building a FMS (Freight Management System) from scratch is complex. Industry-standard systems typically include:

* **Order management** to capture and validate orders
* **Load planning & optimization** to maximize cargo efficiency
* **Carrier management** for contracts, selection, and ratings
* **Route planning** with real-time traffic integration
* **Freight tracking** and visibility
* **Billing, settlements, and analytics** for financial control ([anwire.org][1], [ignitionlogisticssoftware.com][2], [cario.com.au][3], [uffizio.com][4])

Core‚Äë1 addresses the first few components out of the box, leaving plenty of room for clients to extend:

| Layer                 | Provided by Core‚Äë1 | Client can add                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Data & API layer      | ‚úîÔ∏è                 | ‚Äî                                     |
| Order/Schedule flow   | ‚úîÔ∏è                 | ‚Äî                                     |
| Carrier logic         | ‚ùå                  | ‚úì (connect APIs, store contracts)     |
| Route optimization    | ‚ùå                  | ‚úì (integrate mapping or AI libraries) |
| Tracking layer        | ‚ùå                  | ‚úì (IoT, GPS tools)                    |
| Billing / Invoicing   | ‚ùå                  | ‚úì (connect ERP, TMS)                  |
| Analytics & reporting | ‚ùå                  | ‚úì (integrate)                |
| Notifications         | ‚úîÔ∏è basic           | ‚úì (SMS, email templates, webhook)     |

By starting with Core‚Äë1, clients get a working engine for freight workflows and build outward to add billing, tracking, optimization, and reporting.

## How Clients Can Build on Core‚Äë1

### 1. Clone & Explore

```
git clone https://github.com/mrepol742/axleshift-core1.git
cd axleshift-core1
```

Familiarize yourself with the codebase‚Äîits data models for orders, shipments, schedules; the REST API endpoints; and the built-in notification structure.

### 2. Define Your Workflow

Map your business process:

* Order intake (commercial versus TMS vs. API submission)
* Automated scheduling / dispatch rules (e.g., regional hubs, time windows)
* Event-driven triggers (e.g., shipment creation, delays, delivery)

Core‚Äë1 covers initiation and notification‚Äîeverything else can extend via plug-ins or APIs.

### 3. Add Integration Layers

Connect to:

* **Carrier APIs** (e.g., FleetOps, DHL, UPS) for booking, rate requests, tracking
* **Geolocation/Route optimization services** (like Google Maps, GraphHopper, or open-source AI)
* **IoT/GPS devices** for live tracking updates

### 4. Implement Financial & Analytics

* Add billing logic: auto-generate invoices based on distances, carriers, service levels
* Connect to ERP/accounting tools (QuickBooks, SAP)
* Hook into BI dashboards for KPIs like cost per mile, on-time %, load factor ([ignitionlogisticssoftware.com][2], [cario.com.au][3])

### 5. Elevate Notifications & UX

Core‚Äë1 includes basic notifications. Extend them to:

* SMS or email alerts
* Customer portal with shipment tracking
* Admin dashboard for shipment oversight

## Benefits of This Approach

* ‚úÖ **Faster time-to-market** ‚Äì leverage a tested order-to-schedule core
* üîß **Fully customizable** ‚Äì build only what you need (carrier, routing, billing)
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular architecture** ‚Äì plug in third-party systems with clear integration points
* üìà **Scalable foundation** ‚Äì grow into advanced features like AI-route optimization, carbon tracking, analytics dashboards ([axleshift.com][5])

---

## Get Started Today

1. **Fork the repo** and deploy Core‚Äë1 locally (Docker or Node.js stack).
2. **Experiment** by creating test orders and verifying scheduling and notifications.
3. **Plan extensions** based on your use case: carriers? route planners? invoicing?
4. **Build incrementally**: add components one at a time and deploy progressively.

---

### In Summary

AxleShift‚Äôs Core‚Äë1 gives clients a robust, open-source back‚Äëend module to launch a freight management system quickly. Rather than starting from scratch:

* You get battle-tested **order & schedule handling**
* You can **choose only the components you need**
* You can easily **integrate** carriers, EO tools, ERP, analytics
* You retain **full ownership**‚Äîno vendor lock-in

Begin with Core‚Äë1, plug in the rest, and build a freight system tailored to your operations. Need help getting started with a specific integration (e.g. routing, invoicing, real‚Äëtime tracking)? I‚Äôd be glad to help!
